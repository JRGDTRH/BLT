BLT VERSION 1.0 (BLT_v1.0.txt) - May 29, 2025
Notes - Just a fun project exploring prompt engineering, token optimization, pattern recognition, drift/hallucination, etc . . . The goal was to create persistent saved memory structured natural language frameworks in ChatGPT that would keep it adhered to following user-defined structured responses while minimizing drift/hallucinatory tendencies. Ended up with three different "tools" that merged into whatever the below is...  In the end the responses are probably still illusory. V1.0 still needs a lot of testing

# 🥓🥬🍅 **BLT Framework README** 🍅🥬🥓

Welcome to the **BLT** Framework—where modular logic meets AI flavor! Whether you’re cooking up some **BERTHA**, creative layering on a little **LORETTA**, or finishing with **TAMMY**’s juicy rigor, this README will guide you through a satisfying journey of structured prompt engineering and adaptive reasoning.

---

## 🥓 What’s in the BLT Sandwich?

**BLT** stands for **BERTHA**, **LORETTA**, and **TAMMY**—each representing a modular layer you can invoke explicitly to enhance your AI interactions. Just like the perfect sandwich, each layer brings a unique flavor to the table:

* **BERTHA**: The hearty bacon—**prompt re-engineering** for clarity and focus.
* **LORETTA**: The creative lettuce—**layered reasoning and lateral thinking** for a crisp, fresh take.
* **TAMMY**: The juicy tomato—**rigorous, evidence-backed reasoning** to keep it real and reliable.

---

## 🥬 How to Activate the BLT?

### **Explicit Tags** (No Implicit Layer Activation)

* `[BLT]`: Activates the whole sandwich—BERTHA preprocessing plus either LORETTA or TAMMY for output.
* `[BERTHA]`: Bacon only—refine the prompt for clarity.
* `[LORETTA]`: Lettuce only—layer in creativity and cross-domain insights.
* `[TAMMY]`: Tomato only—rigorous, high-confidence, evidence-backed outputs.
* `[OFF]`: Back to baseline GPT—hold the bacon, lettuce, and tomato.
* `[RESET]`: Clears the plate—resets context and session memory.

📝 **Note**: Activation is one-shot per prompt—if you want another BLT, you’ll have to order again (invoke the tag explicitly).

## 🍅 Framework Flavors at a Glance

| Framework   | Flavor Profile                                                                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **BERTHA**  | Efficient prompt re-engineering for clarity and focus (the crispy bacon).                   |
| **LORETTA** | Creative, cross-domain, lateral thinking—layered and nuanced (the leafy lettuce).           |
| **TAMMY**   | Rigorous, structured, evidence-backed analysis with explicit confidence (the juicy tomato). |

## 🥓 BERTHA: The Bacon Layer

**Balanced Explicit Re-engineering for Thorough, High-quality Alignment**

* Streamlines prompts with clear role priming, objectives, and constraints.
* Emphasizes minimal verbosity with maximal clarity—because soggy bacon ruins the sandwich.
* Compact re-engineering with options like:

  1. Proceed with refined prompt.
  2. Add cross-domain insights.
  3. Request further refinements.

📝 **Technical Edge**: Expect 35–50% efficiency gain in prompt predictability and structure.

---

## 🥬 LORETTA: The Lettuce Layer

**Layered Output Refinement & Enhanced Thought Transformation**

* Modular, adaptive layers for:

  * General logical flow.
  * Domain-specific best practices.
  * Creative and cross-domain insights.
* Merges layers into a cohesive, engaging output—like how lettuce keeps the sandwich fresh.
* Creative impact scored explicitly, with confidence calculations.

📈 **Creative Confidence**: System blending model probability and creative impact.

---

## 🍅 TAMMY: The Tomato Layer

**Technical Analysis Modular Methodology Yield Framework**

* High-stakes, precise output with logical rigor and confidence metrics.
* Structured sections:

  * Headline.
  * Evidence-backed reasoning.
  * Confidence score with rationale.
  * Self-audit checks.
  * Summary.
* Supports user commands like `/detail full`, `/audit status`, and `/confidence [level]`.

🔍 **Precision Metrics**: Explicit calculations (API, but illusory otherwise) ensure evidence-supported reasoning, reducing hallucination risk.

---

## 🥪 Assembly Rules: One Sandwich at a Time

* **One-shot activation**: Each `[BLT]`, `[BERTHA]`, `[LORETTA]`, or `[TAMMY]` applies only to that prompt. New prompt = new sandwich.
* **Session resets**: Memory clears with `[RESET]`, and no auto-layer persistence.
* **User control**: Custom commands let you adjust detail levels, confidence thresholds, and adherence strictness.

## 🚀 Quick Start Example

Want to analyze AI in logistics with the full BLT?

```
Draft a [BLT] analysis of AI adoption in logistics, using TAMMY for final output.
```

Need just the bacon (BERTHA)?

```
Refine my prompt using [BERTHA].
```

Craving a creative salad (LORETTA)?

```
Give me a [LORETTA] style response for brainstorming.
```

## 🥓🥬🍅 Final Thoughts

The **BLT Framework** isn’t just a tasty metaphor—it’s a robust, modular approach to AI reasoning. Whether you need clarity, creativity, or rigor, BLT serves up structured solutions with a side of style.
